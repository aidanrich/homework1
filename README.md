## Description

- We were asked to refactor the Horiseon webpage.
- Refactoring with semantic html is important for many reasons. Accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.
- With the use of semantic html we have increased accessibility, which helps with search engine optimization but kept the functionality the same. We also removed redundant css to keep the code clean.
- We learned ways to use semantic html, and futher increased our understanding of html and css.
